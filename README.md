## Q&A

#### Why does my antivirus flag this as a potential threat?

The Patch might be mistakenly flagged due to how cleanopsT7.exe creates its folder structure and injects the DLL into the game. These methods, while safe here, have been used maliciously before, which can trigger your antivirus. Rest assured, no harmful actions are taken; itâ€™s simply a protective false alarm.

#### How does this Patch know who to kick?

It kicks players that have previously been identified as cheaters.

#### How are cheaters determined.

It's usually easy to spot cheaters ingame, these are manually being added to a Database.

#### How do I report a cheater?

You can report a player directly from the Patch-UI, it'd appreciated if you also send a video in our Discord Server at #report-a-user.

#### How is this Patch different then the t7patch by serious?

This Patch also kicks previously identified cheaters, it is mainly intended to be used in Multiplayer games.
