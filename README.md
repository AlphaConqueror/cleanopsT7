## Q&A

#### Why does my anti-virus say its a virus?

The Patch can be mistakenly flagged as a virus or malware. This can happen because an anti-virus may think it behaves similarly to known threats.

#### How does this Patch know who to kick?

It kicks players that have previously been identified as cheaters.

#### How are cheaters determined.

It's usually easy to spot cheaters ingame, these are manually being added to a Database.

You can report a player directly from the Patch-UI, it'd appreciated if you also send a video in our Discord Server at #report-a-user.
